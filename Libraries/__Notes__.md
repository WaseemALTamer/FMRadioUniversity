this folder will contain only external libraries this allows our code
to be self contained



NOTE 
i did not write the  libraries code but i did edit  some of  it to make 
sure that the libraries work since i moved them from the Global arduino
path to a local path as you can see them inside this folder


this librari isolation garntee that it is going  to work event if a new
version of the library comes out that is not backward compatible
